## Inclass: Most Frequent Character Challenge ðŸ§®ðŸ”¡

**Description**:  
Greetings, Astute Algorithmists! ðŸŒŸ Ready to jump into another interesting puzzle? Here's a task that'll keep you on your toes. Given a string named `data`, your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to identify the character that appears most frequently within that string. If there are multiple characters with the same highest frequency, return any one of them. Probe into the depths of the string, and let's find out which character is trying to get your attention the most!

**Constraints**:
1. No built-in functions are allowed except for basic string and character manipulations.
2. Do not create any new variables other than for storing the result.
3. Steer clear from peeking at solutions online.

*Hint*: Remember that strings are nothing more than arrays of characters. Utilize this concept to your advantage. You're closer to the solution than you think!

You are permitted to use the JAVA [Java 8 API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/).

## **Example**:

**Sample Input**:
```java
 String data = "banana";
```

**Sample Output**:
```java
   char result = 'a';  // Because 'a' appears 3 times, which is more frequent than any other character.
```

---

**Sample Input**:
```java
 String data = "applepie";
```

**Sample Output**:
```java
   char result = 'p';  // Because 'p' appears 3 times, more than any other character. However, note that 'e' also appears 2 times, but 'p' still wins.
```

## Homework: **Duplicate Counting Challenge** ðŸ§®ðŸ”¡

**Description**:  
Hello, Dedicated Developers! ðŸŒŸ Time for an intriguing task that'll test your observation and programming skills. Given a string called `data`, your challenge is to count the number of non-unique character sets in that string. By "sets", we mean individual characters in this case. Dive deep into the intricacies of the string and fish out those sneaky duplicates!

**Constraints**:
1. No built-in functions are allowed except for basic string and character manipulations.
2. Do not create any new variables other than for storing the result.
3. Resist the urge to look up solutions online.

*Hint*: This type of problem often appears in coding interviews to check one's proficiency in string manipulations. Trust in your foundational knowledge, stay calm, and let's solve this!

You are permitted to use the JAVA [Java 8 API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/).

## **Example**:

**Sample Input**:
```java
 String data = "abcdefga";
```

**Sample Output**:
```java
   int result = 1;  // Because 'a' is the only non-unique character.
```

---

**Sample Input**:
```java
 String data = "xyzxyzxyz";
```

**Sample Output**:
```java
   int result = 3;  // Because 'x', 'y', and 'z' are all non-unique characters.
```
